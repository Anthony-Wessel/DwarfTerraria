# Temporary Name 'Dwarf Terraria'

### This project is a work-in-progress, inspired by Terraria and built in Godot
I am actively working on this project with a strong focus on iteration. I am learning the Godot engine and also practicing making my own art. I am trying to add quick versions of features and content to start out, with the goal of improving it over time as I gain more experience.
